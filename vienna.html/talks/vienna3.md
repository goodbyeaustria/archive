All is packed up in the [kramdown-service gem](https://github.com/writekit/kramdown-service)
for easy (re)use and as an extra bonus includes a binary, that is, kramup,
that starts up the online editor and service on your local machine
(e.g. use `$ kramup`). Supported conversion options/modes include:

 - HTML  - kramdown in GitHub-Flavored Markdown (GFM) Mode w/ Syntax Highlighter (rouge)
 - HTML  - kramdown in "Classic" Mode
