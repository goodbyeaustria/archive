Welcome. Join Us. Free. No Database Required - Just Some YAML ;-)


## How To Add Yourself

Step 1: Add yourself to the member list, that is, [`_data/members.yml`](https://github.com/austriacodes/vienna.html/blob/master/_data/members.yml).
Example:


``` yaml
- name:    Henry Jekyll                 # your name (required)
  github:  henryj                       # your github handle (required)
  web:     drjkeylls.com                # blog or website address/url (optional)
  twitter: henry                        # your github handle (optional)
```

> Note: Do NOT forget to send a pull request with your [`_data/members.yml`](https://github.com/austriacodes/vienna.html/blob/master/_data/members.yml)
> changes (see above).


Step 2: There's no step 2 ;-)

Thanks! That's it. Welcome to Vienna.html.


## Frequently Asked Questions (F.A.Q.s) and Answers

#### Q: Will there be a meetup.com group for Vienna.html?

A: Sorry. No. We will use a GitHub org (you're looking at the org ;-) for signups, events etc.

#### Q: How do I sign up?

A: See above e.g. add yourself and send in a pull request. Your pull request gets merged and you will also get
an invitation (by email from GitHub) to join the Austria Codes / Vienna.html org as a member. If you accept, you can edit the
members.yml file in your browser - no longer any need for a pull request - and you will show up in the
[people page](https://github.com/orgs/austriacodes/people) too (if you set your preference
to public - default is private).
